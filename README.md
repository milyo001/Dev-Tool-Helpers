|----------|:-------------:|:-------------|
| Any Process Cleaner | Batch file | Terminate all processes with one click, instead of doing it manually. You can replace the name of the process with any name. The batch is configured for Node.JS, I had a bug using wrong Node.JS version for Angular testing(Jasmine/Karma) |
| SQLAutoStopper | Batch file | Check if SQL server is turned on or off and reverse that process (to increase performance, use when you need to play games, mine bitcoin etc.), instead of doing it manually from windows services.  |
